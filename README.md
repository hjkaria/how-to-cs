# `How to Computer Science [in Industry]`: A Simple (and Growing?) Guide
## Disclaimer: I want to point out that there isn't just "one way" to CS and anyone who says that, well... :eyes:. 
### This guide was written with students in mind, so most of the resources are tailored towards internships and new grad roles.

One of the most exciting things about Computer Science and tech is the inherent *freedom*. There are so many things you can do with it, which translates to so many ✨`opportunities`✨. Here's a list of resources that I've found to be useful, in my time as an undergrad studying computer science at the University at Buffalo. While it's by no means a complete list, it can be a good starting point. 

A/N: many opportunities tend to have rolling admission, and priority is given to applications submitted earlier vs. later! It's usually a good rule of thumb to **apply as soon as you can, instead of delaying.**
