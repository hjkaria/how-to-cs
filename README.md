# `How to Computer Science`: A Simple (and Growing) Guide

Here's a list of things that I've found to be useful, in my time as an undergrad studying computer science at the University at Buffalo. While it's by no means a complete list, it can be a good starting point. 

A/N: all the dates listed reflect dates listed in Fall 2018.
