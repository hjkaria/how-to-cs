# `How to Computer Science`: A Simple (and Growing) Guide
## Also want to point out that there isn't just "one way" to CS and anyone who says that, well... :eyes:

If there's one thing people should know about Computer Science, it is its inherent *freedom*. There are so many things you can do with it, which translates to so many `opportunities`. Here's a list of things that I've found to be useful, in my time as an undergrad studying computer science at the University at Buffalo. While it's by no means a complete list, it can be a good starting point. 

A/N: all the dates listed reflect dates listed in Fall 2018. 

Follow up note: many opportunities tend to have rolling admission, and priority is given to applications submitted earlier vs. later! Usually a good rule of thumb to apply as soon as you can, instead of delaying.

### Internships
There are so many internships out there for people interested in tech and studying CS. There are also internships geared towards underclassmen (Freshman and Sophomores). It can be intimidating, applying for jobs -- but the only guaranteed way you won't get the job is if you don't apply!
