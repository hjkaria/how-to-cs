A/N: all the dates listed reflect dates listed in Fall 2018.

### Internships
There are so many internships out there for people interested in tech and studying CS. There are also internships geared towards underclassmen (Freshman and Sophomores). It can be intimidating, applying for jobs -- but the only guaranteed way you won't get the job is if you don't apply!
